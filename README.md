## Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree (Udacity)
## Project 1: Navigation
#### Train a Reinforcement Learning agent with DQN extensions
For this project, I built a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to navigate and collect yellow bananas in a large, square world. 
The world/environment is similar to [Unity's Banana Collector environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).
